### Docs For grandpaterry.xyz Setup

The Dokuwiki and site folders are Dokuwiki and Mkdocs respectively. I didn't back those up. They're just uploads from Beelink (for Dokuwiki) and the Sync folder (for Mkdocs - after doing an **mkdocs build** command.

The main directory and the images and css directories are backed up to the Syncthing **Sync/grandpaterry.xyz** folder.
