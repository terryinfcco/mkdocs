## Python Object Oriented Programming
### Tech With Tim

  * Pretty much everything in Python is an object
  * If you create a string, it's an instance of the class string
  * Methods are dot operators appended to an object
     * string = "hello"
     * print (string.upper())
  * Create an object:
```
    class Dog:
        def bark(self)
            print("Bark")
```
