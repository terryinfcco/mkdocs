title:  "December 23, 2020 Jekyll Mate I3"
---
Worked through Bill Raymond videos on YouTube to get this far with Jekyll. 

Got a note that I can't use passwords on github anymore. I'm going to see what I need to do to fix it. First I enabled 2 factor authentication. 

Fooling around with Mate. Right now using the pantheon layout and changing keyboard shortcuts. 

Back to i3 Window Manager on Ubuntu Mate. Having trouble on my arch install with the wireless network sometimes not being there.
