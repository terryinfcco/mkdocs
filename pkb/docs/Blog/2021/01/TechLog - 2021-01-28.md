## January 28, 2021 Techlog

**NextCloud**
I installed and got nextcloud running on the Raspberry Pi 4. Can't see that I see the point unless I really wanted to replace Dropbox. That would I think be OK if I were running a fancier server on hostinger with more storage. But running it locally doesn't get you any offsite capablility, and at least according to the video I watched there isn't a really good batch upload capability. So I think I'm sticking with SyncThing for the moment.

**Mkdocs Techlog**
I'm playing with the idea of using mkdocs for my techlog. I didn't like Grav, and I would feel better about Jekyll if it had a built in search. So here goes nothing. I installed the mkdocs-blog-plugin from the github page and followed instructions. Works pretty well. I'd like to figure out how to get the dates USA style rather than UK style.

**Pi Zero Inkyphat**
I changed the update time in the crontab to 15 minutes. Seems silly to have it updating every 5 minutes, it's not like the weather changes that often.
