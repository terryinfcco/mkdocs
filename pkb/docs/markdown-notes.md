## Code_Blocks

To get code highlighting enclose the code in triple backticks, and the first set of triple backticks should be followed by a space and then the language (like python).

## Headers

# H1 uses one \# sign
## H2 uses two \# signs
### H3 uses three \# signs
#### H4 uses four \# signs

## Quotes

>A Quote is preceded by a \> (right arrow). It appears with a gray background. 
>It can be combined with other formatting - so you can put a header or bold or italics in a quote.

## Emphasis

**Bold text is created by surrounding the text with 2 asterisks**

___Bold text with italics created by surrounding the text with 3 underscores.___

*Italics is done with one asterisk surrounding text*

## Horizontal Rules

---
A horizontal rule is created with 3 dashes on a line by themselves

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

* Can use asterisks
- or hyphens
+ or plus signs to create a list
    * sub list items are created by indenting with a tab
        * and you can continue to indent.

### Ordered Lists

1. Just precede the list item with a number and a period. 
1. Doesn't matter which number, it will just go in the right order anyway.
    1. Again you can use tabs to indent for a sublist.

## Links

Create a link by surrounding it with left and right arrows.
<https://www.google.com>

To have a name description show up precede the link by the text you want contained in square brackets. [Google](https:www.google.com) Then use parentheses around the url rather than left and right arrows.
